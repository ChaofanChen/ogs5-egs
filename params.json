The code is a branch of OpenGeoSys (www.opengeosys.org) v5.3.3 for deep geothermal reservoir modeling developed by @norihiro-w. \r\n\r\nPlease be aware that \r\n- The code is not fully compatible with the official version.\r\n- Use of the official OGS version is recommended if your problem can work with it.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nCopyright (c) 2015, OpenGeoSys Community (http://www.opengeosys.org)\r\nAll rights reserved.\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\r\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n1.

Compile Lis\r\n2. Download source codes from above links and extract it\r\n3. Compile OGS as\r\n```\r\ncd [source-directory]\r\nmkdir ../build\r\ncd ../build\r\ncmake ../[source-directory] -DOGS_FEM_LIS=ON -DLIS_INCLUDE_DIR=[lis include dir] -DLIS_INCLUDE_DIR=[lis include dir] -DLIS_LIBRARIES=[lis library path]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tutorials\r\nPlease note that some of the tutorials were prepared a few years ago and don't work as it is with the latest source code.\r\n* Basics of heat transport modeling with OGS ([book](https://docs.opengeosys.org/books/geoenergy-modeling-i), [slides](https://github.com/norihiro-w/ogs5-egs/tree/gh-pages/docs/Slides_OGS_Geothermal_Basics.pdf))\r\n* Flow and heat transport modeling in EGS reservoirs with porous media approach ([pdf](https://github.com/norihiro-w/ogs5-egs/tree/gh-pages/docs/Tutorial_EPM.pdf))\r\n* Flow and heat transport modeling in EGS reservoirs with discrete fracture approach ([pdf](https://github.com/norihiro-w/ogs5-egs/tree/gh-pages/docs/Tutorial_DF.pdf)) \r\n* Meshing with Gina ([pdf](https://github.com/norihiro-w/ogs5-egs/tree/gh-pages/docs/Meshing_GINA_SingleFracture.pdf))\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n@norihiro-w (norihiro.watanabe (-a-t-) ufz.de)",
